# NavCumminsApp
NAV CUMMINS

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Students in our college find it very difficult to locate labs, find classrooms, and most importantly their teachers. To overcome this problem, we need to come up with an application where a student can choose a particular teacher, a classroom, or a lab of their choice, and then the application displays the location of the place through a map.

PROPOSED SOLUTIONS
To solve this problem, we came up with NAV CUMMINS. 
This app will first allow a student to select the category in which she wants to search. The categories are 1) Teachers 2) Classrooms 3) Tutorial Rooms 4) Laboratories 5) Others. After selecting a category, students can select the sub-category whose location she wants to find. Lastly, the app will direct you to the location and the floor map. 

Functionality and Concepts used
1)	Buttons
2)	Navigation
3)	Image Importing

Application Link & Future Scope
As of now, we have made this app for the Main Building of CCOEW. It can be further expanded to other buildings in the campus as well.
A search bar can be added where students can search for their teachers just by typing their name instead of scrolling a long list of teachers.
